# Project Log

Append-only, reverse-chronological (newest at top). Each entry opens with `## [YYYY-MM-DD] <kind> | <title>` so `grep "^## \[" log.md | head -20` gives a parseable timeline.

**Kinds:** `ingest` (new source/doc processed), `pr` (PR opened/merged/closed), `decision` (architectural or workflow), `lint` (wiki health-check pass), `session` (notable multi-hour working block), `post-mortem` (failure analysis), `milestone` (project-goal threshold crossed).

## [2026-04-26] milestone | Meeting actions without times = 0 (first half of CLAUDE.md "done" hit)

Worker run on the PR-C3.1 code (PR #31 head `a2bb618`) reports X-Ray Section 9 = `0 meeting actions without times`. Crossover-week bug count: **9 → 0** in a single PR. The CLAUDE.md "Current Goal" — "every action that happened in a meeting must show the time of that meeting" — is satisfied for the benchmark window.

Bucket math holds with no drift warning: `sourced_api(12,324) + sourced_convene(32,429) + sourced_legislation_event(182) + unsourced_journal(6,553) + floor_anchor_miss(6,571) + dropped_noise(6,696) = 64,755 = total_processed`. LegEvent telemetry: 185 attempted / 182 recovered / 3 abstained (the abstain-on-zero-overlap and wrong-chamber safety nets working as designed). Worker completed normally (~2 min cycle), no recurrence of the Apr 25 hang. Section 7 (Sheet vs LIS time parity): 0 rows missing time in Sheet but with time in LIS. Section 8: 0 system alerts. Ledger Health Check: 428 admin / 0 meeting bugs / 0 unclassified.

**Class-2 collapse — unexpected bonus.** The PR was scoped to fix 4 × Class-1 (parent-committee Schedule API gap on HB111/505/972/609). All 5 × Class-2 subcommittee-attribution bugs (HB24/1266/1372/SB494/SB555) collapsed too — confirmed by inspection of `MEETING_VERB_TOKENS` (`calendar_worker.py:362`): `"subcommittee offered"` and `"recommends continuing"` are in the canonical allowlist, so all Class-2 outcomes pass the PR-C3.1 gate. The LegislationEvent endpoint is keyed by **bill + date + chamber** (not committee), so subcommittee-vs-parent attribution doesn't gate time recovery. PR-C4 (originally scoped for Class-2) is provisionally retired — see [[state/current_status#class-2-collapse-via-legislationevent-pr-c31-side-effect]]. Re-open only if Sheet1 `Committee` column accuracy is later promoted from "informational" to a tracked metric.

**Half remaining.** The other half of the "done" criterion — `unclassified → 0` — is still open. Section 9 reports 157 unclassified actions (REVIEW). Sample inspection: predominantly meta rows (agenda links, "House Convenes", "Immediately upon adjournment of …"). PR-C5 will categorize each into NOISE/ADMIN pattern lists.

## [2026-04-26] pr | PR-C3.1 opened as PR #31 — response cache + meeting-verb gate

Branch `claude/pr-c3.1-legislation-event-cached`. Two surgical fixes on the PR-C3 base, both born from the Apr 25 incident post-mortem (entry below):

1. **`_legislation_event_cache`** per-cycle, mirroring the existing `_legislation_id_cache` pattern. Keys are `(bill_num, session_code_5d)`. The endpoint returns the bill's whole event history in one shot, so a single fetch covers every action_date for that bill — eliminates the N+1 fetch that hit the LIS WAF rate-limiter on Apr 25. Negative cache: any failure path stores `[]` so a same-cycle retry storm cannot stack the urllib3 `Retry(total=4, backoff_factor=2)` on top of the rate-limiter. Categorized `push_alert` with `dedup_key` still fires on miss so the failure remains visible.
2. **Meeting-verb gate** — call site changed from `if origin == "journal_default":` to `if origin == "journal_default" and any(v in outcome_lower for v in MEETING_VERB_TOKENS):`. Reuses the existing canonical allowlist at `calendar_worker.py:362` (already used by the convene-times index and HISTORY-vs-witness reconciliation — single source of truth, NOT a parallel list). Collapses the candidate set from "every journal_default row in the full session window" (thousands of admin actions like Prefiled / Referred / Printed) to actual meeting-verb candidates (the Class-1 + Class-2 patterns).

Codex P1 outcome_text matcher, Codex P2 X-Ray denominator (`sourced_legislation_event` bucket + `legislation_event_attempted/recovered` orthogonal counters), Gemini `isinstance(..., dict)` type-safety guards, and the session-code 3-digit limitation docstring are all preserved unchanged from PR-C3 round-2.

Diff scope: `calendar_worker.py` only. `calendar_xray.py` and `pages/ray2.py` unchanged from PR-C3 round-2 (still diff-identical per CLAUDE.md pre-push #4).

**Tests (13/13 passing on Python 3.9 via `python3 test_pr_c3_helper_v2.py`):** all 11 from PR-C3 round-2 still green (matcher behavior unchanged); two new regression tests prove the cache (`test_pr_c31_event_cache_prevents_refetch`: 2 calls for same bill on different dates → exactly 1 LegislationEvent HTTP request; `test_pr_c31_negative_cache_suppresses_retry_on_failure`: HTTP 500 on first call → second call hits `[]` cache, total fetch attempts = 1).

**Branch ancestry note — revert-of-merge resolved via `-s ours` merge.** PR-C3.1 was branched from the PR-C3 tip (`f5745c4`) to preserve a single review surface. After main reverted PR #30 (commit `246cba5`), the merge-base of branch and main was `f5745c4` and the branch's diff-vs-base diverged opposite-direction from main's diff-vs-base — the canonical revert-of-merge three-way conflict. Two attempts were tried before landing the right one: `git revert 246cba5` was a zero-diff no-op (HEAD already had everything the revert removed) and would not have cleared GitHub's conflict block; `git merge -X ours origin/main` silently un-applied module-level constants (`LEGISLATION_EVENT_HEADERS`) on non-conflict lines and broke the resolver with a NameError. Final fix: `git merge -s ours --no-ff origin/main` (commit `a2bb618`) — the strategy form discards theirs tree entirely while still recording main as a merge parent, shifting the merge-base to `246cba5` and clearing the conflict without force-push. Full mechanical analysis: [[failures/assumptions_audit]] #44.

## [2026-04-26] post-mortem | Apr 25 PR#30 worker hang — N+1 fetch + over-broad gate

PR #30 merged 2026-04-25; on the next 15-min worker cycle the GitHub Actions run hung 11+ min vs normal ~2 min and was manually canceled. Reverted on main as commit `246cba5` (the bleed-stop) the same day.

**Root cause #1 — N+1 fetch (dominant cost).** The original `_resolve_via_legislation_event_api` cached `LegislationID` per (bill, session) but NOT the `LegislationEvent` history fetch. The endpoint returns the bill's whole history in one shot, so a single fetch covers every action_date — yet every `journal_default` row in HISTORY.CSV triggered a fresh fetch. With ~3,000 unique bills and likely ~10,000+ journal_default rows across the full session window, the worker issued thousands of redundant HTTP calls. Combined with `urllib3.Retry(total=4, backoff_factor=2)` on 429s, LIS WAF rate-limiting cascaded into 40s+ stalls per affected request.

**Root cause #2 — gate too loose.** `if origin == "journal_default":` fired across the FULL session window (Jan 14 → May 1, NOT the Feb 9-13 investigation window — see `calendar_worker.py:2080`) for thousands of administrative rows ("Prefiled", "Referred to Committee", "Printed") with zero chance of recovering a meeting time. The Class-1 bug pattern is specifically *committee meeting verbs* with no Schedule API entry — orders of magnitude smaller.

**What had been tested and what hadn't.** Standalone unit tests (13/13 pre-merge) covered matcher correctness on the 4 Class-1 + HB1 multi-event cases and the abstain safety nets. They did NOT exercise the gate's selectivity at session scale or the per-cycle HTTP-call count. The reviewer playbook for new fallback paths needs a "candidate-set sizing" check before merge — see [[failures/assumptions_audit]] #42 / #43.

**Remediation.** Both root causes fixed surgically in PR-C3.1 (PR #31 — entry above). Validated by two new regression tests; no force-push, no history rewrite. Audit trail preserved: PR#30 merge → main revert → PR-C3.1 → `-s ours` merge of main → meeting-bug=0 milestone, all visible in linear log.

## [2026-04-25] pr | PR-C3 round-2 + PR #30 merged (and reverted same day)

Pushed Codex P1/P2 + Gemini round-1 review fixes on `claude/pr-c3-legislation-event-fallback` (commit `f5745c4`): outcome_text token-overlap matcher with score=0 abstain (Codex P1); `sourced_legislation_event` added to mutually-exclusive `_bucket_sum` plus orthogonal `legislation_event_attempted/recovered` counters in `calendar_xray.py` + `pages/ray2.py` (Codex P2, files diff-identical per CLAUDE.md pre-push #4); `isinstance(raw_json, dict)` guards on both `r.json()` parses (Gemini); LIMITATION docstring on `_normalize_session_code_5d` documenting the 21st-century "20" prefix assumption with upgrade path (Gemini). 11/11 standalone tests passing. Pre-push audit caught a stale `calendar_worker.py:942` line ref in the LIMITATION docstring (actual line was 1233, now 1259); replaced with a search-string anchor that won't rot.

PR #30 merged at `4d398ac`. The very next worker cycle hung 11+ min and was manually canceled — see [post-mortem](#2026-04-26-post-mortem--apr-25-pr30-worker-hang--n1-fetch--over-broad-gate) above. Reverted on main as `246cba5`. Net same-day status: PR-C3 round-2 code returned to a feature branch, awaiting the surgical fix that became PR-C3.1.

## [2026-04-25] ingest | LIS API surface fully inventoried (developer portal + LegislationEvent verified)

PR-C2.1 was reverted yesterday after headless verification proved the "historical web scraper" premise wrong (no public web source has 2026 data the Schedule API doesn't). Today's deeper investigation surfaced the actual recovery path: the **LegislationEvent API** publishes minute-precision `EventDate` timestamps for every bill action, including the 4 Class-1 bug actions (HB111/505/972/609 on Feb 12) where the Schedule API has zero entries for the parent committee.

**Verification results (read-only probes, single cycle):**
- HB111 (P&E Feb 12) → `EventDate: 2026-02-12T21:02:00`
- HB505 (P&E Feb 12) → `EventDate: 2026-02-12T21:02:00`
- HB972 (P&E Feb 12) → `EventDate: 2026-02-12T21:03:00`
- HB609 (Finance Feb 12) → `EventDate: 2026-02-12T09:24:00`

All four have recoverable times via `https://lis.virginia.gov/LegislationEvent/api/GetPublicLegislationEventHistoryListAsync?legislationID={id}&sessionCode=20261`.

**Owner correction (mid-investigation): the LIS dev portal at `lis.virginia.gov/developers` lists ALL 31 public API services**. LegislationEvent is not new or hidden. The brain previously documented only 3 (Session/Committee/Schedule), so this knowledge was effectively lost. [[knowledge/lis_api_reference]] now contains the full inventory plus the LegislationEvent + LegislationVersion contracts.

**Three integration gotchas captured in the brain:**

1. **Two distinct public WebAPIKeys.** The legacy worker key (`81D70A54-...`) covers Session/Committee/Schedule but returns 401 on the new MVC endpoints. The SPA's public key from `handleTitle.js` (`FCE351B6-...`) covers everything. Neither alone covers the full API surface.
2. **Two session-code formats.** Legacy 3-digit `261` works on Schedule/Committee/Session; new MVC endpoints (LegislationEvent, LegislationVersion, AdvancedLegislationSearch, ...) require 5-digit `20261` and reject the legacy form with `"Provided Session Code is invalid"`.
3. **Two-step bill→ID→events lookup.** `LegislationEvent` requires `legislationID` (not `billNumber`). One extra hop through `LegislationVersion/api/GetLegislationVersionbyBillNumberAsync` resolves it. LegislationID is stable per session — cacheable.

**Next:** PR-C3 — surgical 80-120 line addition in `calendar_worker.py`: `_resolve_via_legislation_event_api(bill_num, action_date)` as fallback in the time-resolution chain (after API_Schedule, before `journal_default`). Targets exactly the 4 Class-1 bugs. Class-2 (subcommittee attribution) remains a separate problem; LegislationEvent's `CommitteeNumber/CommitteeName` are `None` on vote-style events so this API doesn't help that class directly.

## [2026-04-24] pr | PR#29 merged — PR-C2 (gap detection + Schedule_Witness + reconciliation)

Merged into `main` at 17:17 UTC after three rounds of Gemini review (round-1 inline at PR open, round-2 Location/prune/canary patches, round-3 `col_values()` scale-cliff fix). Merge commit `fddfea6`. Final shipped scope: Y1 gap-detection with 7 `gap_cause` classes + WARN/CRITICAL thresholds; `Schedule_Witness` change-feed tab (13 cols, ADDED+CHANGED only, whitelist-iterated `WITNESS_DELTA_FIELDS = (Time, SortTime, Status, Location)`, migration burst guard, retention deferred to L3b Nightly Audit); HISTORY-vs-witness reconciliation with 7-day cap. Zero bug-count delta as expected — observability + data-recovery infrastructure. Counters added to `source_miss_counts`: `gap_minutes`, `gap_cause`, `witness_rows`, `witness_location_backfills`, `reconciliation_blind_dates`, `reconciliation_checked_dates`. Three follow-ups still flagged in [[ideas/future_improvements]]: L3b Nightly Audit (witness retention owner), PR-C2.1 Playwright historical scraper (data-recovery), Notification Routing for `y1_stale` / `gap_reconciliation_oversized` / `gap_critical` CRITICALs. Next: PR-C3 (LegislationEvent API as secondary time source) — first fix-pass that collapses Class 1 bugs.

## [2026-04-24] pr | PR-C2 round-3 patch — col_values() for reconciliation witness-date index

Single-point fix in response to Gemini round-3 HIGH review of PR #29. Part C reconciliation was reading the `Schedule_Witness` tab via `get_all_values()` to build the prior-cycle `witness_dates` index. Given the 90-day retention target and high cycle frequency, the change-feed can approach Sheets' 10M-cell ceiling, and pulling the entire sheet into memory every cycle is a latent scale cliff that eventually breaks the worker via timeout or memory pressure. Only `meeting_date` is needed for the index. Switched to `col_values(WITNESS_HEADER.index("meeting_date") + 1)` which fetches only that column. Header cell is sliced off via `[1:]`. The existing try/except fallback-to-deltas-only semantics is unchanged, so a col-read failure still degrades gracefully.

Adversarial audit: WITNESS_HEADER is the canonical schema we write at tab creation (inside `_ensure_witness_tab`), so index lookup against the constant is stable and matches what's on the tab. No schema drift risk unless someone hand-edits the tab header — and in that case the col fetch still returns the data, just potentially from a different column; the fallback semantics would give weaker reconciliation for one cycle until detected. Acceptable. No other `witness_tab.get_all_values/get_all_records` call sites in the worker (grep-verified). AST parse clean.

Docs updated: architecture/calendar_pipeline Part C bullet 2 now documents the `col_values()` path + the memory-cliff rationale.

## [2026-04-24] pr | PR-C2 round-2 patches — Location delta, prune moved to L3b, size canary

Pushed three patches on the open PR-C2 branch in response to Gemini round-2 review. Owner greenlit Concerns 1 + 2 for the current branch; Concern 3 (Playwright scraper) deferred to PR-C2.1.

**Concern 1 — Location/Room missing from witness (round-1 junk-delta whitelist + round-2 "Missing Room Update"):** `WITNESS_DELTA_FIELDS = ("Time", "SortTime", "Status", "Location")` constant introduced with DO-NOT-ADD-METADATA warning. Delta comparison rewritten to iterate the whitelist — never iterate `_wval.items()` or any future metadata key becomes a delta trigger. `_extract_meeting_location(meeting)` uses a `Location → Room → RoomDescription` fallback chain (the field is not documented in [[knowledge/lis_api_reference]]) and logs which key fired. Location threaded through `api_schedule_map`, `new_cache_entries`, API_Cache header + compaction. `WITNESS_HEADER` grew from 11 → 13 cols (`location`, `prev_location` appended to both the current-state and prev-state halves). **Migration burst guard:** on first cycle(s) after deploy, API_Cache-seeded entries have Location="" while live entries are populated — without suppression every meeting would emit a bogus CHANGED delta. Suppress ONLY when the delta is {"Location"} and it went empty→populated; count in `witness_location_backfills` so the one-time burst is visible but quiet. Real room moves (both sides non-empty) still emit. One-time header migration in the cache-read path writes `F1="Location"` if missing, so subsequent cycles can actually read the column back (without this, the burst guard would fire forever).

**Concern 2 — Pruning race (round-1 "Pruning Race Condition"):** removed the in-cycle `append_rows` + `col_values(1)` + `delete_rows` block entirely. Same-cycle append-then-delete on a Google Sheets tab is a documented eventual-consistency race that can silently delete rows we just wrote. Retention is now owned by an L3b Nightly Audit (TODO, see [[ideas/future_improvements#L3b Nightly Audit — Schedule_Witness retention owner (flagged 2026-04-24, PR-C2 round-2)]]) running outside the 15-min hot path. Cycle still does a cheap `col_values(1)` read as a size canary: exposes `witness_rows` in `source_miss_counts` and fires `witness_canary_over_threshold` WARN at > 500,000 rows so L3b lag is visible.

**Concern 3 — Playwright scraper deferred to PR-C2.1.** Will use `wait_for_selector()` tied to the actual schedule-table DOM element (NOT `wait_for_load_state("networkidle")` which hangs on bloated gov sites) and ≥ 15s per-date timeout (5s was too aggressive for LIS at peak session). Flagged in [[ideas/future_improvements#PR-C2.1 — Playwright historical scraper (deferred from PR-C2)]].

**Adversarial audit (embedded at commit time):** Caught a NameError bug during audit — `WITNESS_DELTA_FIELDS` was originally defined after the live loop but referenced inside it; hoisted the constants block above the pre-live snapshot so closure order matches execution order. API_Cache schema migration is idempotent; compaction + rollback blocks both padded to 6 cols so writes stay rectangular. No new silent fallbacks: every new except path has a categorized alert with a unique dedup_key. Whitelist iteration means we cannot accidentally add a new field without explicitly opting in. AST parse clean.

## [2026-04-24] pr | PR-C2 opened — gap detection + witness log + reconciliation

Second PR in the PR-C series, on branch `claude/pr-c2-gap-detection-witness-log`. Three-part scope, all landing together so data-recovery infrastructure is cohesive:

**Part A — Y1 gap detection.** Parses `Sheet1!Y1` (written by PR-C1), computes `gap_minutes = now_utc − Y1`, classifies `gap_cause` as one of `first_run`, `future_cursor`, `stale_cursor` (>30 d), `malformed_cursor`, `breaker_carryforward` (W1 populated), `outage`, `normal`. Emits WARN at >20 min gap, CRITICAL at >60 min, CRITICAL on stale_cursor. `gap_cause` and `gap_minutes` land in `source_miss_counts` for SYSTEM_METRICS. `_gap_window_start_utc` becomes the usable bound for Part C — set ONLY when Y1 parses cleanly and is neither future nor stale. All comparisons use `datetime.now(timezone.utc)` (PR-C1 Codex P1 fix already made the UTC import available).

**Part B — `Schedule_Witness` change-feed tab.** Append-only log of ADDED + CHANGED LIS Schedule API deltas, one row per delta (11 cols: `seen_at_utc | run_id | event_type | meeting_date | committee | time | sort_time | status | prev_time | prev_sort_time | prev_status`). Pre-live deep-copy snapshot of `api_schedule_map` is diffed against post-live state BEFORE the `best_times` post-pass so the witness captures raw LIS signal. REMOVED deferred — can't reliably distinguish "LIS dropped it" from "LIS did not return it this poll" given cross-session cache staleness. Data-loss detection for that case is Part C's job. Tab auto-created on first delta. 90-day rolling prune via lexical sort of ISO timestamps + single `delete_rows(2, N)`. Write NOT gated by the circuit breaker — witness rows have to survive breaker trips, since the entire point is reconciliation on the next healthy cycle. Volume math: steady-state well under 10M-cell Sheets limit (change-feed, not snapshot); cold-start ~3.3k ADDED burst then normalizes.

**Part C — HISTORY-vs-witness reconciliation.** Runs ONLY when `gap_cause in {outage, breaker_carryforward}` AND `gap_minutes >= 60`. Hard cap `GAP_RECONCILIATION_MAX_DAYS = 7`: over cap, CRITICAL `DATA_ANOMALY` alert + skip (manual review required). Within cap, builds gap date range in ET, builds witness date index (this cycle's deltas + all prior Schedule_Witness rows), filters `df_past` (HISTORY.CSV) to meeting-verb rows in gap window, and for each date with HISTORY meeting-verb rows but zero witness evidence emits a WARN `DATA_ANOMALY` labeled "CONFIRMED BLIND-WINDOW LOSS". Date-granularity (not committee-granularity) because HISTORY doesn't carry committee directly — resolving committee would force reconciliation to run AFTER the Sequential Turing Machine, which defeats the "cheap and independent" goal. `reconciliation_blind_dates` / `reconciliation_checked_dates` added to `source_miss_counts`.

**Future-consideration flag.** Owner flagged during scoping that the CRITICAL alerts here (`y1_stale`, `gap_reconciliation_oversized`, `gap_critical`) may eventually want a dedicated dashboard or push channel rather than routing through `SYSTEM_ALERT` rows. Tagged in code comments on both alert sites, in [[architecture/calendar_pipeline#Future-consideration flag]], and in a new section in [[ideas/future_improvements#Notification Routing (flagged 2026-04-24, PR-C2)]].

Adversarial audit (because Codex/Gemini don't re-review mid-stream): 9-point pre-push checklist clean; boundary conditions verified — Y1 parse handles None + ValueError + future + stale + malformed; delta computation survives api_is_online=False (empty deltas, no write); prune handles all-old / all-new / empty-tab / single-row / multi-row cases; breaker interaction confirmed (trip leaves Y1 untouched → next cycle detects as `breaker_carryforward`); source_miss_counts mixed int/string values serialize cleanly via `json.dumps`; no new silent fallbacks (every except has a categorized alert).

Zero bug-count delta expected. This is observability + data-recovery infrastructure; PR-C3 (LegislationEvent API) is the first fix-pass that collapses Class 1 bugs.

## [2026-04-21] pr | PR-C1 review fixes — Codex P1/P2 + Gemini denominator

Three review findings on PR #28 addressed in one follow-up commit on `claude/pr-c1-append-event-chokepoint`. All three are real issues; all three surface anti-patterns worth extracting so future PRs don't repeat them. New entries #38, #39, #40 in [[failures/gemini_review_patterns]].

**Codex P1 — Y1 stored as ET mislabeled UTC:** `now = datetime.now(America/New_York).replace(tzinfo=None)` at L722. My Y1 write used `now.strftime("%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ")` — the `Z` suffix is a lie, it's actually local ET wall-clock time. A PR-C2 consumer treating Y1 as UTC would shift the gap-backfill window by 4–5 hours across DST, either missing or double-processing intervals. Fix: added `timezone` to the datetime import, compute `_cycle_end_utc = datetime.now(timezone.utc)` at breaker evaluation time, use `_cycle_end_utc.strftime(...)` for Y1 and the breaker message. All other uses of `now` (alert rows' human-readable timestamp, date keys) stay ET because those are ET-facing fields. Anti-pattern #38.

**Codex P2 — breaker alert not durable:** `push_system_alert` appends to `alert_rows`, which is a function-local list persisted to Sheet1 ONLY as part of the main `worksheet.update(...)` call. The breaker path deliberately skips that update — so the alert died with the process. My architecture doc's claim "goes to `alert_rows` (so the next healthy cycle surfaces it)" was flat wrong — `alert_rows` resets each cycle. Fix: added a durable JSON trip record at `Sheet1!W1` (compact banner stays at X1), plus a carry-forward READ at the top of the next cycle that converts the W1 record into a proper `DATA_ANOMALY / CRITICAL` SYSTEM_ALERT row. W1 is cleared on successful overwrite so the carry-forward doesn't double-report. SYSTEM_ALERT monitors now see breaker trips one cycle delayed instead of never. Anti-pattern #39.

**Gemini high — denominator semantics:** `_violation_rate = invariant_violations / total_processed` used a denominator that counted pipeline entries including rows dropped before `_append_event` (noise filter, state-machine drops). Numerator can only fire INSIDE `_append_event`. Rate was silently diluted. Gemini's suggestion was to move `total_processed` increment into `_append_event` — I took a variation that preserves existing denominator-bucket math: added a new orthogonal counter `rows_appended` inside `_append_event`, used as the breaker's rate denominator. `total_processed` stays as the mutually-exclusive-bucket sum it's always been (Section 0 denominator). Anti-pattern #40.

**Also updated:** [[architecture/calendar_pipeline]] breaker section corrected re: in-memory alert durability; added W1 subsection; flagged real-UTC requirement on Y1.

**Phase-2 re-audit after fixes:** AST parse pass, `_append_event` still defined exactly once, diff visibility grep still empty. Ready to push.

## [2026-04-21] pr | PR-C1 opened — write-time chokepoint + circuit breaker + state cell + concurrency

First PR in the PR-C series. Pure scaffolding — lands the infrastructure that PR-C2+ (the actual bug fixes) depend on. Zero bug-count delta expected from C1 alone; this is a prerequisite for auditable fix-passes. Branch: `claude/pr-c1-append-event-chokepoint`.

**Five pieces shipped (diff: +265 / -9 across 2 files + 3 doc files):**

1. **Write-time chokepoint `_append_event()`** — nested closure inside `run_calendar_update()`, defined once, used at all 5 bill-row append sites (API chamber event, DOCKET row, API_Skeleton DLQ row, API_Skeleton agenda row, main CSV loop row). Enforces four invariants:
   - **I1** — schema completeness (all 11 columns). Missing keys fill with `""`, push `DATA_ANOMALY / CRITICAL` alert.
   - **I2** — `Origin` in the enumerated set `{api_schedule, convene_anchor, journal_default, floor_miss, system_alert, system_metrics}`. Out-of-enum pushes alert; row is NOT dropped (visibility beats silence).
   - **I3** — concrete-source Origins (`api_schedule` / `convene_anchor`) cannot carry a `⏱️ [NO_*]` Time string. Parity violation pushes alert.
   - **I4** — telemetry counter (no invariant): meeting-verb outcome AND Origin in `{journal_default, floor_miss}` increments `meeting_unsourced`. Feeds the circuit breaker.

2. **Mass-violation circuit breaker** — just before `worksheet.clear() + worksheet.update()`, evaluates three thresholds:
   - `violation_rate > 10%` (invariant_violations / total_processed)
   - OR `invariant_violations >= 50` absolute
   - OR `meeting_unsourced >= 50` (baseline today for crossover week: ~9)

   On trip, the worker REFUSES the Sheet1 overwrite — leaves the previous cycle's data intact as last-known-good. Banner written to `Sheet1!X1`, `DATA_ANOMALY / CRITICAL` alert pushed. Y1 is NOT advanced, so PR-C2's gap-backfill naturally covers the skipped cycle. Thresholds are intentionally generous — a safety net for regressions, not a gate on normal operation.

3. **State cell `Sheet1!Y1`** — `last_successful_cycle_end_utc`. Written with the ISO UTC timestamp after every successful overwrite. Read at cycle top (logged only in C1; C2 will consume it as the "since" cursor). Empty on first post-C1 deploy is expected and does not alert. Read/write errors emit categorized `API_FAILURE` alerts.

4. **GitHub Actions `concurrency`** on `calendar_worker.yml`: `{ group: calendar-worker, cancel-in-progress: false }`. If cycle N's runtime slips past 15 min, cycle N+1 queues rather than running in parallel. Never cancels mid-flight — half-written Sheet1 is worse than a delayed cycle.

5. **Counter schema additions** in `source_miss_counts`: `invariant_violations` (rows that failed I1/I2/I3 at append time) and `meeting_unsourced` (meeting-verb outcome + unsourced Origin). Both overlap the existing denominator buckets by design — orthogonal-tag pattern, same as `unsourced_anchor` and `dropped_ephemeral` (see [[failures/gemini_review_patterns]] #31).

**Module-level constant added:** `MEETING_VERB_TOKENS` (high-recall list mirroring `tools/crossover_audit/diff_sheet1.py` MEETING_VERBS — the two lists should stay in sync). False positives only elevate the telemetry counter, never drop or reclassify rows.

**Self-audit against 9-point pre-push checklist:** pass.
- (1) Verb forms — MEETING_VERB_TOKENS covers base/past/present as the crossover-audit pair does; no new conjugation lists.
- (2) Function scope — `_append_event` defined once, nested in `run_calendar_update`, before all call sites.
- (3) Doc version sync — architecture doc updated in same PR.
- (4) Duplicate file check — no `pages/ray2.py` / `calendar_xray.py` drift (PR doesn't touch X-Ray).
- (5) Architecture conformance — [[architecture/calendar_pipeline]] now has "Write-Time Safety Rails (PR-C1)" section.
- (6) Zero-trust data — all four invariants emit categorized alerts; no silent paths introduced.
- (7) Cross-list validation — MEETING_VERB_TOKENS overlaps with ABSOLUTE_FLOOR_VERBS, DYNAMIC_VERBS, KNOWN_EVENT_PATTERNS by design (orthogonal tagging, not classification).
- (8) Import resolution — no new top-level imports touched.
- (9) Source-miss visibility — grep on diff is empty; no new `continue` / `except: pass` / `"Time TBA"` sites.

**Writing back to:** [[architecture/calendar_pipeline]] (Write-Time Safety Rails section), [[state/current_status]] (PR-C1 added to Open PRs, Active focus updated), this entry.

**After Gemini review:** merge → PR-C2 (gap-backfill consuming Y1) → PR-C3 (LegislationEvent secondary time source, collapses Class 1) → PR-C4 (subcommittee attribution, collapses Class 2).

## [2026-04-20] pr | PR #27 review fixes — encoding, portability, phantom_row coverage

Six review comments from Gemini + Codex on the crossover-audit tooling addressed in one commit on branch `claude/crossover-audit`.

**Medium (Gemini):**
- `build_universe.py`, `diff_sheet1.py`: open HISTORY.CSV as `iso-8859-1` (per [[knowledge/lis_api_reference]]). Defensive — current snapshot happens to be pure ASCII, but that won't hold forever.
- `extract_truth.py`: `html.unescape()` added to `strip_tags` so LIS-emitted `&amp;` / `&nbsp;` / numeric refs don't desync downstream string compares against API-sourced text.
- `fetch_bills.sh`: `CHROME` path via env-var override with executable-bit check, so the script runs on Linux/CI without editing.

**Codex:**
- `fetch_bills.sh` (P2): capture Chrome exit status; report `FAIL` distinctly from `UNDERSIZED`. Previous version masked non-zero rc by redirecting stderr.
- `diff_sheet1.py` (P1): iterate `universe | sheet_bills` (union, not intersection) so phantom-row checks also cover the 19 bills in Sheet1 with no Feb 9-13 HISTORY activity. Re-ran: `phantom_row: 0` still holds — all 19 are correctly-classified `Outcome: Scheduled` placeholders (non-action).

**Extra fix caught during verification:**
- `diff_sheet1.py`: `sorted(all_dates)` before iteration so `crossover_audit_findings.json` is deterministic across runs. Python set iteration is hash-randomized; findings.json was churning on every re-run and cluttering diffs.

**Findings summary unchanged:** `meeting_in_ledger: 9`, `phantom_row: 0`, `subcommittee_miss: 0`. See [[testing/crossover_audit]].

**PR-C direction (decided this session, not yet coded):** LegislationEvent API (`GET /LegislationEvent/api/GetLegislationEventByLegislationIDAsync?legislationID=<int>`) is the bank-grade source. Per-bill event dump carries ISO `EventDate`, `CommitteeName`, `ParentCommitteeName`, `EventCode`, `VoteTally`. Requires a pre-built bill→integer-ID map (AdvLegSearch + sequential sweep covers all 3,634 session 20261 bills; the published `GetLegislationIdsListAsync` returns only 2,831). Coverage on the 9 known bugs: 6 fully rescued; 3 are LIS-side data holes (HB24 has no meeting-verb event; SB494 Feb 12 and SB555 Feb 12 × 2 carry `00:00` midnight-stub timestamps). New quirk logged to [[knowledge/lis_api_reference]] as follow-up.

**Fallback chain order** (to be implemented in PR-C):
1. `LegislationEvent` API, join-by-(bill, date) so fields merge across multiple events on the same day
2. `Schedule` API by (committee, date) for bills where LegislationEvent is committee-only or blank
3. `HISTORY.CSV` refid parsing (H18001 → parent H18) as last-resort committee attribution
4. `SOURCE_GAP` alert — never silent-fallback to `Time TBA` or `12:00`

## [2026-04-19] session | Crossover Week full-universe audit completed — X-Ray Section 9 bug count confirmed at 9

Ran tier-A ground-truth audit: 1,544 bills × 6,885 LIS actions vs 4,473 Sheet1 rows, Feb 9-13 2026 window. Pipeline: `tools/crossover_audit/{build_universe.py, fetch_bills.sh, extract_truth.py, diff_sheet1.py}`. Raw DOM via headless Chrome (see [[knowledge/lis_dom_scraping]]).

**Headline:** the X-Ray Section 9 bug count of **9 is the actual, full-window crossover-week bug count.** Confirmed zero hidden meeting-misrouted rows, zero phantom rows, zero silent bill-drops. The 51 bills in HISTORY-but-not-in-Sheet1 are all Fiscal-Impact-Statement-only entries correctly filtered as noise. See [[testing/crossover_audit]] for full findings table, 9-bug exemplars with LIS committee attributions, and class distribution.

**Class distribution:**
- **Class 1 (Schedule API gap at full committee):** 4 bugs — HB111/HB505/HB972 (Feb 12 H-P&E meeting), HB609 (Feb 12 H-Finance). Two upstream API gaps = 4 of 9 bugs. Fixing the secondary time source collapses Class 1 entirely.
- **Class 2 (Subcommittee attribution miss):** 5 bugs — HB24, HB1266, HB1372, SB494, SB555. State-machine / attribution bugs in worker's subcommittee resolution path.

**Instrumentation observation (not a bug, but worth noting):** 423 admin-verb rows are tagged `⏱️ [NO_SCHEDULE_MATCH]` because the worker runs the schedule lookup on every row regardless of verb class. Consider narrowing the tag to rows whose verb class implied a meeting was expected. Logged to [[state/open_anti_patterns]] as item #8.

**Artifacts checked in:**
- `docs/testing/crossover_lis_truth.json` — 1.3 MB, 6,885 actions structured per-bill
- `docs/testing/crossover_audit_findings.json` — 180 KB, categorized discrepancies
- `tools/crossover_audit/` — reproducible pipeline

**Lesson learned (scraping):** LIS bill-details DOM uses nested `<span>` tags in descriptions. A naive regex over the history-event-row block over-captures across row boundaries. The fix (row-split BEFORE parsing) is now documented in [[knowledge/lis_dom_scraping]] so the next scraping task doesn't repeat the mistake. Caught during audit dry-run by noticing empty LIS truth on bills that clearly had HISTORY activity — investigating revealed the regex bug rather than accepting "LIS is missing rows."

Next: PR-C scoping. Two-track fix — secondary time source for Class 1 (4 bugs) + subcommittee resolution fix for Class 2 (5 bugs). No code written until audit is reviewed.

## [2026-04-16] pr | PR-B opened — metrics visibility + source-miss diagnostic hint

Branch: `claude/pr-b-metrics-visibility-diagnostic` from `origin/main` post-PR#25-merge. Two focused fixes cashing in on real-world behavior of PR-A:

1. **Viewport slice was filtering out the `SYSTEM_METRICS` row.** PR-A stamped the metrics row with `Date=today` (run timestamp) so it'd write on every cycle. The end-of-pipeline viewport slice then filtered `final_df` to `scrape_start <= Date <= scrape_end` (= Feb 9-13, 2026), silently dropping the `Date=2026-04-16` metrics row before Sheet1. X-Ray Section 0 rendered blank even though upstream counters were correct. Fix: exempt `Origin in {system_alert, system_metrics}` from the window mask (`final_df = final_df[in_window | is_system]`). Logged as [[failures/gemini_review_patterns]] #36.
2. **NO_SCHEDULE_MATCH rows now carry a `DiagnosticHint` column.** New pre-loop dict `api_schedule_by_date` indexes `api_schedule_map` by date. `_build_diagnostic_hint()` produces `loc='<bill_locations[bill]>'; api_<date>=[<committee>@<time>; ...]` (nearest-3 same-chamber candidates). Populated in both `journal_default` and `floor_miss` branches; empty string for sourced rows. Added to all 9 `master_events.append` sites (4 API-sourced = `""`, 1 CSV branch = populated, plus push_system_alert / SYSTEM_METRICS / cache_alert meta sites). X-Ray Sections 4d, 9 sample rows, and the Ledger Health Check "meeting actions in Ledger" expander now surface the column when present. Sheet1 schema: 10 → 11 columns. Logged as [[failures/gemini_review_patterns]] #37.

Also re-synced `calendar_xray.py` with `pages/ray2.py` and updated [[architecture/calendar_pipeline]] schema section.

## [2026-04-16] pr | PR#25 merged — worker source-miss visibility instrumentation (PR-A)

Merged into `main` after Gemini review follow-up commits. Worker ran successfully with the new counters (mutual-exclusive denominator = 63,081). The `SYSTEM_METRICS` row never reached Sheet1 because of the viewport-slice bug documented in PR-B's entry above.

## [2026-04-16] pr | PR#25 updated — Gemini review follow-up for PR-A

Five issues from Gemini review of PR#25, logged as [[failures/gemini_review_patterns]] #31-#35:

1. **#31 Counter double-counting.** `source_miss_counts` split into mutually-exclusive denominator buckets (`sourced_api`, `sourced_convene`, `unsourced_journal`, `floor_anchor_miss`, `dropped_noise` — sum to `total_processed`) and orthogonal tag counters (`unsourced_anchor`, `dropped_ephemeral` — overlap intentional). `unsourced_anchor` now fires on every Memory-Anchor row regardless of time resolution.
2. **#32 Origin/metric parity.** Floor transitions from `api_schedule` to `convene_anchor` now decrement `sourced_api` and increment `sourced_convene`, so row Origin matches the counter.
3. **#33 Dedup-key scope.** `no_match` alert key now includes `bill_num` per [[workflow/source_miss_visibility]].
4. **#34 Redundant import.** Removed local `import json as _json`; use module-level `json`.
5. **#35 Origin field parity.** Added `Origin="api_schedule"` to 4 `master_events.append` sites in the Schedule API branch.

X-Ray Section 0 rewritten to visually separate denominator buckets (with sum-check warning on drift) from orthogonal tag counters.

## [2026-04-16] pr | PR-A opened — worker source-miss visibility instrumentation

Branch: `claude/worker-source-miss-visibility`. Instrumentation-only PR that cashes in all five items from [[state/open_anti_patterns]]:

1. `calendar_worker.py` L756 — `except: print` cache fallback now also calls `push_system_alert(..., category="API_FAILURE", severity="WARN")`.
2. L~1201 Memory Anchor path now tags both admin and dynamic verbs (`📝 [Memory Anchor: admin]` vs `⚙️ [Memory Anchor]`).
3. L~1181 silent `"Journal Entry"` default replaced with `"⏱️ [NO_SCHEDULE_MATCH]"` tag + deduped `push_system_alert` (category `TIMING_LAG`, severity `WARN`).
4. L~1340 ephemeral-filter silent `continue` replaced with counter + deduped alert (category `DATA_ANOMALY`, severity `INFO`).
5. Ledger-Updates rename (L~1363) now gates off a new `Origin` column (`journal_default` / `floor_miss` / `api_schedule` / `convene_anchor` / `system_alert`) instead of the renamed Time string, so provenance survives.

Also: `push_system_alert` extended to accept `category`, `severity`, and `dedup_key`; a JSON-encoded `SYSTEM_METRICS` row is written to Sheet1 per run. X-Ray `pages/ray2.py` gains Section 0 rendering the denominator (total / sourced / unsourced / dropped). `calendar_xray.py` re-synced.

Expected effect: bug count goes *up* short-term because previously-silent rows now surface with visible tags. That is the point — per [[failures/pr22_post_mortem]], the old metric was rewarding silencing.

## [2026-04-16] pr | PR#24 opened — Gemini review follow-up for the brain PR

Four doc fixes flagged by Gemini on PR#23: (1) removed placeholder `[LLM-Wiki](https://github.com/)` link in `docs/README.md`; (2) aligned severity labels in `docs/state/open_anti_patterns.md` to CLAUDE.md Standard #4 (`INFO`/`WARN`/`CRITICAL`); (3) `<mod>` → `<module>` in CLAUDE.md pre-push audit point 8 for consistency with [[workflow/three_phase_protocol]]; (4) corrected the log entry below to cite the actual migrated files (`feedback_always_push.md`, `project_tba_discovery.md`) instead of just the `MEMORY.md` index. Also untangled stale "PR#23" references in [[state/current_status]] and [[state/open_anti_patterns]] that referred to the instrumentation PR before PR#23 was assigned to the brain PR.

## [2026-04-16] pr | PR#23 merged — Obsidian brain consolidation

Vault is live on `main`. Primary checkout now carries `docs/` as the project brain. Follow-up fixes in PR#24 address Gemini review.

## [2026-04-16] decision | Consolidated brain into Obsidian-compatible wiki

Restructured `docs/` as an Obsidian vault. Created `index.md`, `log.md`, `state/`, and `workflow/` subtrees. Migrated the two entries from global `~/.claude/.../memory/` (`feedback_always_push.md` and `project_tba_discovery.md`, both indexed by `MEMORY.md`) into `[[workflow/push_and_pr]]` and `[[knowledge/tba_times]]`. Updated [[README]] as the vault entry point. CLAUDE.md now routes all persistent memory writes here, not to global memory.

Trigger: user reported scattered knowledge between `docs/` and hidden `~/.claude/` memory folder; adopting the LLM-Wiki pattern with Obsidian as visual interface.

## [2026-04-16] post-mortem | PR#22 framework failure — "only measuring the bugs we wanted"

See [[failures/pr22_post_mortem]] and [[state/open_anti_patterns]]. User invalidated PR#22's reclassification premise (members really do offer amendments in committee). Audit of `calendar_worker.py` found the anti-pattern PR#22 inherited is still live in four places: line ~1181 (silent "Journal Entry" default), lines ~1248-1261 (ephemeral `continue`), lines ~1158-1167 (selective Memory Anchor tag), lines ~1269-1275 (Journal → Ledger rename without provenance). Section 9 bug metric was measuring symptoms, not source-miss rate.

New workflow rule created: [[workflow/source_miss_visibility]]. PR#22 to be closed unmerged by user.

## [2026-04-15] pr | PR#22 opened — `[chamber] (sub)committee offered` as admin override

Reclassified 8 crossover-week "offered" rows as administrative via `ADMIN_OVERRIDE_PATTERNS`. Premise later invalidated by user pushback. Logged as [[failures/assumptions_audit]] entry #41. To be closed.

## [2026-04-14] pr | PR#21 merged — `_REPO_ROOT` file-probe replaces dir-name check

Gemini PR#20 review flagged brittle `_HERE.name == "pages"` check. Replaced with `(_HERE / "investigation_config.py").exists()` probe. Logged as [[failures/gemini_review_patterns]] pattern #30.

## [2026-04-13] pr | PR#20 merged — sys.path prelude fix for `pages/ray2.py`

Streamlit subpage threw `ModuleNotFoundError: investigation_config` on deploy after PR#19. Added sys.path prelude. Logged as [[failures/assumptions_audit]] #39.

## [2026-04-12] pr | PR#19 merged — window alignment via `investigation_config.py`

Rolling `scrape_end = now + timedelta(days=7)` was expanding the bug count mechanically every run. PR#14-18 metrics were polluted. Pinned to `INVESTIGATION_START/END = Feb 9-13` in a single module, imported by worker + X-Ray. Logged as [[failures/assumptions_audit]] #38.

## [2026-04-11] pr | PR#18 merged — "prefiled and ordered printed" → admin override

2,042 prefiled rows were misclassifying as meetings due to substring "offered". Added to `ADMIN_OVERRIDE_PATTERNS`. Logged as [[failures/assumptions_audit]] #37. (Note: #37's call about bare "committee offered" being a meeting was later invalidated by #41.)

## [2026-04-10] pr | PR#17 merged — subcommittee vote refid regex fix

`resolve_committee_from_refid()` regex missed H14003V... format (parent + 3-digit subcommittee + V + vote ID). 1,637 subcommittee refids were unlocked. Logged as [[failures/assumptions_audit]] #36.

## [2026-04-09] pr | PR#16 merged — sub-panel schedule matching + overwrite protection

Added Strategy B in `find_api_schedule_match` for hyphen-suffixed sub-panels (HCJ-Civil, etc.) that aren't in Committee API. Added map overwrite protection so "Time TBA" can't clobber concrete times. Logged as [[failures/assumptions_audit]] #34, #35.

## [2026-04-08] pr | PR#15 merged — whitespace normalization + session marker fallback

Session marker fallback now overwrites non-concrete placeholder times. `_is_non_concrete_time` hoisted to module level. Logged as [[failures/assumptions_audit]] #32, #33.
